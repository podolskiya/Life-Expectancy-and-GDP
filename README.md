# Life-Expectancy-GDP-Liberty
Here is my portfolio project showcasing my Python and Data Analysis skills

Here are the objectives I consider incorporating in my code:
### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Handle missing or null values within the datasets.
* Normalize/standardize the data if necsesary for better analyzis.
* Identify and handle outliers that might affect the analysis.
### 2. Statistical Analysis
* Perform statistical tests to quantify the relationship between GDP and life expectancy and Liberties.
* Conduct regression analysis to model the relationship between these variables.
### 3. Data Visualization
* Create visualizations using libraries such as Pltly
* Visualize the geographical distribution of GDP and life expectacny using maps (Folium)
### 4. Machine Learning Techniques:
* Implement predictive models like linear regression or decision trees to forecase life expectancy based on GDP
* Evaluate and compare different machine learning modelos for prediciton accuracy
### 5. Time Series Analysis:
* Explore how GDP and life expectancy have changed over time for selected  regions.
* Apply time series forecasting techniques to predict future trends.
### 6. Paper
* Write a brief paper regarding findings from this analysis.
