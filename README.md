# CivilLiberty-GDP-LifeExcpectancy
Here is my portfolio project showcasing my Python and Data Analysis skills

Here are the objectives I consider incorporating in my code:
### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Handle missing or null values within the datasets.
* Normalize/standardize the data if necsesary for better analyzis.
* Identify and handle outliers that might affect the analysis.
### 2. Statistical Analysis
* Perform statistical tests to quantify the relationship between GDP per capita and Life Expectancy and Liberties.
  * Simple linear regression: GDP per capita and Life Expectancy, GDP per capita and Liberties, Life Expectancy and Liberties
  * Multiple linear regression: What is the effect of Liberties and GDP per capita on Life Expectancy
  * Pearson's r: Life Expectancy and Liberties
* Conduct regression analysis to model the relationship between these variables.
### 3. Data Visualization
* Create visualizations using libraries such as Pltly
* Visualize the geographical distribution of GDP per capita and life expectacny using maps (Folium)
### 4. Machine Learning Techniques:
* Implement predictive models like linear regression or decision trees to forecase life expectancy based on GDP per capita
* Evaluate and compare different machine learning modelos for prediciton accuracy
### 5. Time Series Analysis:
* Explore how GDP per capita and life expectancy have changed over time for selected  regions.
* Apply time series forecasting techniques to predict future trends.
### 6. Paper
* Write a brief paper regarding findings from this analysis.

### Disclaimer: 
This is in no way to progress or dismiss any political stances. Civil liberties index has been accused of political bias and is subjective to an extent, nevertheless, if provides with a valuable data and allows for a best available data regarding civil liberties and countries' adherence to democratic values.
